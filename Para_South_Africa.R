# logcurve(base, target, base_year, target_year, growth, shape)
# "base" and "target" are the initial and final values
# "shape" determines the symmetry of the curve
# with "shape=1" the curve is symmetric around the midpoint of "base_year" and "target_year"
# "growth" determines the steepness of the curve
# "ss" determines how often to output values
